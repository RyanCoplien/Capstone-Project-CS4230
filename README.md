MongoDB Instructions:

This can be done through commands or utiling the MongoDB Compass. I would reccomend the compass as its very easy to do this compared to commands but links to commands are also provided.

1. Create a MongoDB database called Hospital (https://beginnersbook.com/2017/09/mongodb-create-database/). 
2. Create collection called RawData (https://beginnersbook.com/2017/09/mongodb-create-collection/).
3. Import data.csv into RawData (https://kb.objectrocket.com/mongo-db/how-to-import-a-csv-into-mongodb-327).
